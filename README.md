# DNN-from-scratch
This is basic deep neural network implementation from scratch in python. This NN desigen for hand written digits classification.

# Datasets and Training
The neural network is trained on 60000 MNIST hand written digits and tested on 10000 MNIST hand written digits.
The overall accuracy of the model is 99.3% on training data and 98.7% on test data.

# Architecture
The architecture of the model is divided as - 
- input layer with 784 input nodes
- one hidden layer with 300 nodes
- final output layer with 10 nodes
Internally the model uses sigmoid activation function
